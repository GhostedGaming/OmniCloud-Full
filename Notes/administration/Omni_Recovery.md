## Understanding OmniCloud Backup ISOs

When a disaster strikes and you lose your entire OmniCloud infrastructure, you'll need to rebuild from backup ISOs. These aren't bootable media – they're just standardized file containers holding your OmniCloud environment's complete state. Think of them as highly organized archives that package up everything needed to recreate your environment from scratch.

We use the ISO 9660 format because it's standardized, has built-in integrity verification, and works across pretty much any storage system. Each backup set includes multiple ISO files that contain specific pieces of your environment:

1. **System-Core-ISO**: Contains the core system configuration, encryption keys, and recovery metadata
2. **Director-State-ISOs**: One or more ISOs containing Director configurations and state information
3. **Orchestrator-State-ISOs**: Multiple ISOs containing the distributed Orchestrator database and state
4. **Volume-Data-ISOs**: Series of ISOs containing application data volumes, distributed by application
5. **Application-Definition-ISOs**: Contains application configurations, deployment specifications, and metadata
6. **Network-Configuration-ISO**: Contains network policies, routing tables, and connectivity specifications

Inside each ISO, you'll find a consistent structure:

```
ISO_ROOT/
├── metadata/
│   ├── manifest.json       # Lists all files and their checksums
│   ├── backup_info.yaml    # Backup timestamp, version, and configuration
│   ├── recovery_index.db   # SQLite database indexing all backup components
│   └── digital_signature/  # Digital signatures for verification
├── data/
│   ├── [component-specific data files]
│   └── [database dumps, configurations, etc.]
├── scripts/
│   ├── recovery/           # Recovery automation scripts
│   ├── validation/         # Integrity checking scripts
│   └── transformation/     # Data transformation utilities
└── recovery.log            # Log of the backup creation process
```

This standardized structure makes it easy for recovery tools to quickly find what they need, no matter which ISO they're working with.

## Setting Up Your Recovery Environment

First things first, you need the right hardware. For your recovery control node, get something decent – 8 cores, 32GB RAM, and a 500GB SSD should do the trick. I usually use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Make sure it has network access to all your target nodes. For your target infrastructure, either prepare bare-metal servers or VMs that match or beat your original specs. Double-check all the networking, and document your MAC addresses and hardware details – this saves a ton of headaches later.

Installing the recovery toolkit is straightforward:

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install prerequisites
sudo apt install -y curl wget jq python3 python3-pip libarchive-tools genisoimage

# Download Recovery Toolkit
curl -LO https://recovery.omnicloud.io/tools/omni-recovery-toolkit-3.2.tar.gz

# Verify toolkit checksum
echo "e8c5b727a025f47e95d5f5766dfe07a3821c3ae4a04c0304d126de865e129107  omni-recovery-toolkit-3.2.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c

# Extract toolkit
mkdir -p /opt/omni-recovery
tar -xzvf omni-recovery-toolkit-3.2.tar.gz -C /opt/omni-recovery

# Run installation script
cd /opt/omni-recovery/toolkit
sudo ./install.sh

# Verify installation
omni-recovery version
```

When you've got the toolkit installed, you need to register all your ISO backup files. Create a working directory, initialize the recovery database, and point the registration tool at your ISOs:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir -p /opt/omni-recovery/workspace
cd /opt/omni-recovery/workspace

# Initialize recovery database
omni-recovery init-database

# Register ISO files
omni-recovery register-isos --path /path/to/iso/files
```

The process examines each ISO, pulls out the metadata, and builds a comprehensive recovery index. This index basically maps out your entire environment as it existed in the backup – all the components, their relationships, and any special requirements for bringing them back.

Before you start the actual recovery, take time to validate your ISOs and create a proper recovery plan:

```bash
# Perform deep validation of ISO files
omni-recovery validate-isos --deep

# Generate recovery plan
omni-recovery plan-generate --output recovery-plan.yaml
```

Run a deep validation to verify checksums, check digital signatures, and confirm consistency across the entire backup set. The recovery planner will generate a YAML file defining the exact sequence of operations needed, including dependencies, wait conditions, and fallback procedures. This plan is your roadmap – follow it closely.

## Processing Your ISO Files

Now that you've got your environment set up and your plan in hand, it's time to execute the recovery. The beauty of Omni's recovery system is that once you've done the initial setup and validation, the actual recovery process is fully automated. Just run a single command:

```bash
# Execute the recovery plan
omni-recovery execute-plan --plan recovery-plan.yaml
```

This one command handles everything - extracting the ISO files, cataloging their contents, populating the recovery database, scanning your new infrastructure, and adapting the configurations to work in the new environment. The system preserves the internal structure of the ISOs while building a detailed catalog that maps every file to its purpose in the recovery.

Behind the scenes, the import process parses all the config files, rebuilds the state database, resolves cross-references, and adapts configurations to your new infrastructure. This database becomes your authoritative source for rebuilding the environment, containing everything from network topology to application specs.

One of the most important parts that happens automatically is adapting your backed-up configuration to your new infrastructure. The system scans your available hardware, generates the appropriate adaptations, and applies them without requiring your intervention at each step.

This process maps your original hardware specs to what's now available, adjusts network configs for the new environment, and optimizes resource allocation. Think of it as translating your old environment to work properly in its new home.

## Initializing Your Directors

The recovery process continues automatically with Director initialization. You don't need to manually run commands for each step - the recovery system handles it all based on the generated plan. The system takes care of deploying the operating system to Director nodes, installing the Director software, configuring everything properly, and restoring the Director state from backup.

If you're curious about what's happening behind the scenes, the recovery system is:

1. Deploying a minimal compatible OS to each Director node
2. Setting up basic networking and secure SSH access
3. Installing the Director software with all binary components, libraries, and certificates
4. Applying the full Director configuration from backup
5. Restoring the complete Director state, including VM definitions and operational history

The system also automatically handles Director ring formation, which gives you distributed control of your infrastructure, consensus on resource allocation, and redundancy for VM management. The ring is essential for coordinated operation during recovery.

The ring gives you distributed control of your infrastructure, consensus on resource allocation, and redundancy for VM management. It's essential for coordinated operation during recovery. Once the ring is formed, verify it works properly before moving on.

## Recovering Your Orchestrators

Next, the recovery system automatically handles Orchestrator recovery. You don't need to issue separate commands - the system follows the recovery plan and executes each step in sequence, with proper error handling and verification built in.

Orchestrators run as applications on VMs managed by Directors. The recovery process handles all the VM deployment, Orchestrator installation, and state restoration seamlessly. Here's what's happening during this phase:

1. The Directors create and deploy VMs specifically configured for the Orchestrators
2. Once the VMs are running, the Orchestrator applications are deployed
3. All binary components are installed, services configured, and databases established
4. The backed-up Orchestrator state is fully restored, bringing back all your:
   - Database contents
   - Configuration settings
   - Application definitions
   - User accounts and permissions
   - Cluster policies and rules

After restoring all Orchestrators, the system automatically forms them into a functional cluster. This establishes leader election mechanisms, consensus protocols, state synchronization, and self-healing capabilities - all the elements that make your control plane robust and reliable.

The system continually verifies each step before proceeding, ensuring that your Orchestrators are properly recovered and functioning before moving on to the next phase.

This sets up leader election, consensus protocols, state synchronization, and self-healing capabilities – all the stuff that makes your control plane robust and reliable.

## Restoring Your Services

The recovery process continues automatically with service restoration, following the optimal order to get your environment back up and running. The system handles the entire process without requiring you to issue separate commands for each component.

The recovery starts with storage services, since pretty much everything else depends on them. This phase typically takes the longest, since it involves moving large amounts of data from the ISO files to your storage systems. The system automatically:

1. Prepares the storage infrastructure
2. Deploys all necessary storage services
3. Restores volume definitions from backup
4. Transfers all volume data from the ISO files to the proper storage locations

Once storage is fully operational, the system automatically recovers your core system services, including:
- Authentication and authorization services
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Network management services
- Internal DNS and service discovery
- API gateway and access control

Finally, the system restores user applications in order of priority:
1. Critical applications are restored first
2. Standard applications follow
3. Each application's definitions are recreated in the Orchestrators
4. Containers are deployed and connected to their restored data volumes
5. Monitoring and logging are established for all applications

When everything is running, the system performs a final verification, generates a comprehensive recovery report, and transitions to normal operation. You'll get a notification when the process is complete, along with the detailed report showing everything that was recovered and any adjustments that were made during the process.

This removes any temporary recovery configurations, establishes normal security, creates a new monitoring baseline, and kicks off your first post-recovery backup.

## Technical Implementation Details

Under the hood, the ISO processing uses specialized tools to mount the ISO files or extract them, verify file integrity with the embedded checksums, process metadata to build your recovery database, and transform data as needed for the new environment. The extraction process works in parallel to save time:

```bash
# Example of the underlying extraction process (simplified)
mkdir -p /mnt/iso-temp
sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso-file.iso /mnt/iso-temp
rsync -av /mnt/iso-temp/data/ /opt/omni-recovery/extracted/data/
sudo umount /mnt/iso-temp
```

The recovery database itself is PostgreSQL-based. It contains:
1. **Component registry**: Catalog of all system components
2. **Configuration store**: All configuration parameters
3. **State information**: Operational state of components
4. **Dependency graph**: Relationships between components
5. **Recovery tracking**: Progress of the recovery operation

Wherever possible, the recovery system works in parallel:

```bash
# Example of parallel Director deployment
omni-recovery deploy-directors --parallel 5 --config director-config.yaml
```

This can massively reduce recovery time for large environments – definitely worth using if your hardware can handle it.

The adaptation system is pretty sophisticated. It has to handle:
- Hardware mapping between original and new specifications
- Network configuration adjustments
- Storage path redirection
- Resource allocation scaling

Security is maintained throughout the process through:
1. Encryption of sensitive data in ISO files
2. Certificate regeneration for the new environment
3. Secure channels for all recovery communications
4. Authentication for all recovery operations
5. Audit logging of the entire process

## Real-World Recovery Scenarios

One of the best things about OmniCloud's recovery system is how streamlined it is, regardless of environment size. Whether you're recovering a small lab setup or a massive production environment, it's the same automated process and can always be handled by a single administrator. The system does all the heavy lifting - you just need to get the recovery started and monitor progress.

For small environments with around 5 nodes, you're typically looking at 1-2 hours for complete recovery. For larger environments with 50+ nodes, expect 3-6 hours total. The process scales remarkably well because of the parallel processing capabilities built into the recovery system.

The recovery system supports both complete and partial recovery. If you need to restore specific applications rather than the entire environment:

```bash
# Example of recovering only specific applications
omni-recovery execute-plan --plan recovery-plan.yaml --applications app1,app2,app3
```

When recovering to significantly different infrastructure, the system automatically handles all the adaptations:

```bash
# Execute recovery with advanced adaptation mode
omni-recovery execute-plan --plan recovery-plan.yaml --adaptation-mode advanced
```

The advanced adaptation mode performs more sophisticated hardware mapping, network reconfiguration, and resource distribution to accommodate major differences between your original and new infrastructure.

## Optimizing Recovery Performance

You can optimize the recovery process by adjusting parameters in the recovery plan or by using command-line options when starting the recovery:

```bash
# Example of starting optimized recovery with high parallelism
omni-recovery execute-plan --plan recovery-plan.yaml --parallel-factor 10 --io-priority high
```

To speed up recovery:
- Use SSDs for your recovery workspace
- Ensure high bandwidth between recovery nodes
- Increase the parallel-factor parameter
- Set priority levels for different components in the recovery plan

If you're working with limited resources:

```bash
# Start recovery in resource-efficient mode
omni-recovery execute-plan --plan recovery-plan.yaml --mode resource-efficient
```

This reduces parallelism to save memory, optimizes disk usage during extraction, staggers operations to avoid resource spikes, and uses compression where it helps.

After recovery completes, the system will automatically analyze performance and suggest optimizations. You can apply these with a single command:

```bash
# Apply recommended optimizations after recovery
omni performance optimize --apply-recommendations
```
